                <p>hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf</p>
                <p>of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our</p>
                <p>salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and</p>
                <p>mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with</p>
                <p>penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may</p>
