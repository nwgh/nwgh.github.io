                Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of
                Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to
                hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf
                of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our
                salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and
                mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with
                penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may
                obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
            </div>
            <div>
                Most merciful God,
                we confess that we have sinned against you
                in thought, word, and deed,
                by what we have done,
                and by what we have left undone.
                We have not loved you with our whole heart;
                we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.
                We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.
                For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,
                have mercy on us and forgive us;
                that we may delight in your will,
                and walk in your ways,
                to the glory of your Name. Amen.
            </div>
            <div>
                Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins
                through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all
                goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in
                eternal life. Amen.

                <h2>Venite <span class="cite">Psalm 95:1-7</span></h2>
                <p>Come, let us sing to the Lord; let us shout for joy to the Rock of our salvation.</p>
                <p>Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving and raise a loud shout to him with psalms.</p>
                <p>For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods.</p>
                <p>In his hand are the caverns of the earth, and the heights of the hills are his also.</p>
                <p>The sea is his, for he made it, and his hands have molded the dry land.</p>
                <p>Come, let us bow down, and bend the knee, and kneel before the Lord our Maker.</p>
                <p>For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand. Oh, that today you would hearken to his voice!</p>

                I believe in God, the Father almighty,
                    creator of heaven and earth;
                </p>
                <p>
                I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.
                    He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit
                        and born of the Virgin Mary.
                    He suffered under Pontius Pilate,
                        was crucified, died, and was buried.
                    He descended to the dead.
                    On the third day he rose again.
                    He ascended into heaven,
                        and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
                    He will come again to judge the living and the dead.

                I believe in the Holy Spirit,
                    the holy catholic Church,
                    the communion of saints,
                    the forgiveness of sins
                    the resurrection of the body,
                    and the life everlasting. Amen.
