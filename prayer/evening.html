        <h1>Daily Evening Prayer</h1>
        <div>
            Dearly beloved, here in the presence of Almighty God,
            let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient
            hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by
            his infinite goodness and mercy.
        </div>
        <div>
            Most merciful God,
            we confess that we have sinned against you
            in thought, word, and deed,
            by what we have done,
            and by what we have left undone.
            We have not loved you with our whole heart;
            we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.
            We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.
            For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,
            have mercy on us and forgive us;
            that we may delight in your will,
            and walk in your ways,
            to the glory of your Name. Amen.
        </div>
        <div>
            Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins
            through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all
            goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in
            eternal life. Amen.

            My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,
                my spirit rejoices in God my Savior;
                for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.
            From this day all generations will call me blessed:
                the Almighty has done great things for me,
                and holy is his Name.
            He has mercy on those who fear him
                in every generation.
            He has shown the strength of his arm,
                he has scattered the proud in their conceit.
            He has cast down the mighty from their thrones,
                and has lifted up the lowly.
            He has filled the hungry with good things,
                and the rich he has sent away empty.
            He has come to the help of his servant Israel,
                for he has remembered his promise of mercy,
            The promise he made to our fathers,
                to Abraham and his children for ever.

            I believe in God, the Father almighty,
                creator of heaven and earth;

            <p>
            I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.
                He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit
                    and born of the Virgin Mary.
                He suffered under Pontius Pilate,
                    was crucified, died, and was buried.
                He descended to the dead.
                On the third day he rose again.
                He ascended into heaven,
                    and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
                He will come again to judge the living and the dead.
            </p>
            <p>
            I believe in the Holy Spirit,
                the holy catholic Church,
                the communion of saints,
                the forgiveness of sins
                the resurrection of the body,
                and the life everlasting. Amen.
