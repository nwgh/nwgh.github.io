I am a concerned citizen and educator writing on behalf of immigrant families in my community and I strongly oppose the proposed public charge rule that would hurt millions of children and families.
<p>
As an educator in the local community college system, I am especially concerned about the impact this proposal will have on my students and their families. Every semester, I work with students who are immigrants themselves and/or have family members who are immigrants. Due to the high cost of higher education and living expenses, these students regularly have to juggle their academic responsibilities while working low-wage jobs to support themselves and their families. In order to succeed academically, and achieve their goals, my students have to depend on a number of programs to support their basic needs. They cannot focus and succeed in the classroom when their basic needs are not met.
<p>
This proposed regulation has already made tax-paying immigrant families afraid to seek programs that support their basic needs including healthcare. These critical programs have helped to improve participants’ health, well-being, school success, and economic security. With about one in four children having at least one immigrant parent, this issue touches millions and is critical now and for our nation’s future. 
This rule specifically assigns a negative weight to factors like age, health, family since, and income. The rule outlines that being too young, too old, too poor, or too sick could be held against an immigrant seeking a legal change in status – even if they or their family members are working. In addition, the rule targets family-based immigration, which disproportionally impacts people of color. If this regulation moves forward, only the wealthiest and healthiest immigrants would have the opportunity to build a future in the United States. This rule runs counter to our nation’s fundamental values.
<p>
For these reasons, I strongly oppose the Department of Homeland Security’s public charge proposed rule.
