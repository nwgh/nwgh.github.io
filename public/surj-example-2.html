I am writing as a concerned citizen and person of faith in opposition to the proposed change in public charge rules.
<p>
The United States has for over a hundred years been identified with the Statue of Liberty. This statue bears upon its pedestal a sonnet containing the phrase “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free” — a phrase that has also come to be identified with immigration in the United States. And indeed, this has historically been the aspiration of immigration in the United States — to be a beacon of hope for persons whose home countries will not take care of them. This proposed change fundamentally undermines our aspirations as a nation.
<p>
In the United States, much is often made about our society’s roots in the Judeo-Christian heritage. As a Christian, I am called to welcome the stranger. The Hebrew Bible is filled with admonitions to care for the foreigner sojourning in your lands, as is the New Testament. I must stand with my brothers and sisters who have been endowed by their Creator with the same inalienable rights I have. For the United States to attempt to shirk its duties of care for foreigners is nothing less than a rebuke of the Judeo-Christian heritage that we claim to be so proud of.
<p>
We can not allow our country to simultaneously abandon our heritage and our hopes for the future. It is for these reasons, and for the sake of our nation’s integrity, that I oppose the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed changes to the public charge rule.
